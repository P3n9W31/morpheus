This repository contains code for the paper "[It's Morphin' Time! Combating Linguistic Discrimination with Inflectional Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04364)" (to be presented at ACL 2020).

# Usage
To generate adversarial examples for one of the implemented models, run the corresponding `run_morpheus_*` script.

## Custom tasks, datasets, or models
Morpheus can be easily implemented for a custom task, dataset, or model by following the structure of existing classes:
`MorpheusBase` implements the methods common to all Morpheus implementations; `Morpheus<Task>` implements methods common to a specific task/dataset, `Morpheus<Model><Task>` implements methods specific to a particular model (usually the `init` and `morph` methods).

## Generating adversarial training data
Use `random_inflect/random_inflect.py` to generate adversarial training data. You will need to pass in a dictionary of inflection counts for it to work in the weighted sampling mode, otherwise a uniform distribution will be used. The dictionary should be in the form 

```
{
  "inflection tag": int,
}
```
E.g.,
```
{
  "VB": 150,
  "VBD": 100,
  ...
}
```
